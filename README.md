> **Your history is their product. Let's delete it.**
>
> Instagram is designed to be like that clutter drawer in your kitchen. Easy to throw stuff in but a nightmare to clean out. They want you to keep every like and follower because that data keeps you hooked. **UnLikeIt** gives you the keys to the exit door so you can wipe your digital footprint in minutes.

<br>

## ⚡ Why Does This Exist?

Social media platforms use "dark patterns" which are basically sneaky design choices that make it annoying to delete your history. They do this on purpose.

**UnLikeIt is your digital eraser.** We automate the boring stuff so you can move on.

✨ **Reclaim Your Privacy**
Wipe years of interaction history that you didn't even know was still lingering on your profile.

✨ **Stop Data Hoarding**
Delete thousands of likes and comments without spending your entire weekend clicking manually.

✨ **No Coding Required**
Forget complex developer scripts. If you can click a button then you can use this tool.

## 🎯 The Good Stuff

### 1. Master Control Center
*A secret button that gives you superpowers.*

🔹 **Sleek Design:** A clean and modern interface that looks like it actually belongs on Instagram.

🔹 **Smart Routing:** The script acts like a GPS. It automatically guides you to the specific pages you need to be on to get the job done.

### 2. Advanced Relationship Manager
*Find out who is ghosting you.*

🔹 **One-Click Scanning:** Instantly compares your "Following" list against your "Followers" to spot the people who don't follow back.

🔹 **Whitelist System:** Mark your besties as "Safe" so you never accidentally unfollow them during a purge.

🔹 **Visual Grid:** See exactly who you are removing with full profile pictures and names. No accidental unfollows here!

### 3. Context-Aware Interaction Cleaner
*The nuclear option for your history.*

🔹 **Bulk Eraser:** Works on both Likes and Comments.

🔹 **Time Travel Sorting:** Automatically sorts by "Oldest to Newest" so you can erase your cringey posts from 2016 first.

🔹 **Humanizer Engine:** We use random and human-like delays so Instagram doesn't think you're a robot.

## 🎓 Fuel the Dev

I'm just a university student building this in my spare time between exams and assignments.

If this tool saved you 5 hours of manual clicking or helped you clean up your digital footprint then please consider buying me a coffee! It literally fuels my late-night coding sessions and helps keep the updates coming.
